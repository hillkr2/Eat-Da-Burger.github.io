# Eat-Da-Burger.github.io
Our main file, which houses most of the dependencies that we'll be using and the initial server set-up, is server.js
We set up and populate our database with schema.js and seeds.js
Then, we create our connection to the database in connection.js
We develop our ORM to run simpler methods to query database (read, write, and update)
Our controller takes in the data response from the queries, and then routes and renders it via Handlebars, resulting in a fully
functional app
We have our GET request, which retrieves burgers; POST request, which adds burgers; and PUT request, which updates the status of burgers from not devoured to devoured
Requirements
Allow user to add burgers
Display existing and added burgers to the left-hand side of the app with a corresponding "EAT" button
Display devoured burgers to the right-hand side of the app
Store all burgers and their devoured state in a database
Installation
Run node.js and perform an npm install to bring in all liabrary and necesarry node modules. The program is run with the command "node server.js"
